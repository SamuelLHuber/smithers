/**
 * Surface manifest for the validation slideshow capture pipeline.
 *
 * Each entry describes one feature of the Smithers PWA and how the capture
 * script should reach it:
 *
 * - id            kebab-case, used as the screenshot/gif filename and slide id
 * - title         human label for the slideshow heading
 * - kind          how to arrive: a route URL, a slash command typed into the
 *                 composer, or a free-form sequence of steps
 * - path          for kind === "route" — the URL path
 * - command       for kind === "slash" — the slash text typed into the composer
 * - waitFor       optional selector that must be visible before capturing
 * - description   short feature summary printed on the slide
 * - validation    notes about what the corresponding playwright spec proves
 * - motion        phase-by-phase recipe for interaction sequences. Each phase
 *                 runs its steps, waits for its selector, then snapshots a
 *                 frame. Used by the onboarding splash → welcome → builder
 *                 sequence so each frame is anchored on a real DOM state
 *                 instead of a blind setTimeout.
 *
 * The order here is the order surfaces appear in the slideshow. Keeping the
 * manifest as plain data lets unit tests (and the slideshow generator) iterate
 * without touching the page driver.
