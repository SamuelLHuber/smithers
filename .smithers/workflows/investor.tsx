/**
 * A keyboard-driven Smithers investor pitch deck for a 10-20 minute screenshare.
 *
 *   ▸ / Space / Enter / Down  — next slide
 *   ◂ / Up                    — previous slide
 *   r                         — replay current slide's narration
 *   m                         — mute / unmute audio for the rest of the deck
 *   q / Esc                   — quit
 *
 * This is the investor-facing companion to demo.tsx (the technical deck).
 * Where demo.tsx sells the engineering, this deck sells the company: the
 * problem, the solution, the market (small + medium businesses automating
 * their work), traction (real npm + GitHub data, rendered as live charts),
 * the open-source flywheel, third-party ecosystem, business model, the
 * competitive landscape, and the reputation-led enterprise go-to-market.
 *
 * Every number in the TRACTION act is REAL data pulled from the npm
 * downloads API and the GitHub stargazers/contributors API on 2026-06-17.
 * Update the DATA block below before each pitch — see refreshData() notes.
 *
 * One slide (LIVE PROOF) runs a REAL nested `smithers up` against the stage
 * workflow at `.smithers/workflows/demo-stage/sample.tsx` to prove crash +
 * resume durability live. It degrades gracefully if the stage is missing.
 *
 * Usage (from repo root):
 *   ./.smithers/scripts/run-investor.sh
 *   ./.smithers/scripts/run-investor.sh --silent
 *   ./.smithers/scripts/run-investor.sh --start-at 10
