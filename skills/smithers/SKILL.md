description: Drive Smithers — a durable control plane for long-running coding agents. Use when the user wants multi-step, long-running, crash-safe, or human-in-the-loop agent work: "orchestrate agents", "run a workflow", "implement this and review it", "keep iterating until tests pass", "plan then build", or anything that needs retries, approvals, replay, or evals across multiple AI steps. YOU (the agent) run Smithers on the user's behalf — it is not a GUI the human clicks.

# Smithers

Smithers is a durable control plane for long-running coding agents. Workflows are
TypeScript (JSX), run for minutes or days, and survive crashes — every finished
step is persisted to SQLite, so a restart resumes from the last completed node
instead of starting over. Retries, human approvals, replay, evals, and sandbox
review all live in one place.

## You drive it, not the human

This is the thing to internalize: **you, the AI agent, operate Smithers.** The
human asks for an outcome ("implement rate limiting and don't stop until the
tests pass"); you reach for Smithers, run the workflow, watch it, and report
back. Smithers spawns *other* agents (Claude Code, Codex, etc.) as the workers
inside a workflow — you are the operator standing at the control panel, not a
person clicking buttons in a UI.

So when a task is bigger than one prompt — it has stages, needs to survive a
crash, needs a human to approve a step, or needs to loop until something is
true — don't hand-roll it turn by turn. Run a Smithers workflow.

### ⚠️ Orchestrator-only: Smithers does the work, your subagents do not

**This is a hard rule. Read it twice.**

You are an **orchestrator, not an implementer.** For any task that runs in the
background, takes more than a couple of minutes, has multiple steps, or could
fail and need a retry — **do NOT spawn your own subagents (the Task tool,
sub-tasks, "let me fan out N parallel agents") to do the work. Run a Smithers
workflow instead.** Smithers is the durable layer your ad-hoc subagents are not:
its steps persist the instant they finish, resume after a crash, retry on
failure, loop until a condition holds, run in isolated worktrees, and stay
inspectable for days. Hand-rolled subagents lose all of that the moment your
turn ends or the process dies — their work is gone and there is nothing to
resume from.

The division of labor is strict:

- **Smithers does the work.** Every real, long-running, or multi-step task —
  implement, debug, research, plan, review, migrate, audit, "keep going until
  X" — goes into a Smithers run. Smithers spawns the *worker* agents (Claude
  Code, Codex, …) inside the workflow; that is where implementation happens. You
  do not re-implement it yourself or in your own Task subagents.
- **You orchestrate and observe.** Your job is to translate the human's request
  into the right workflow, launch it, watch it (`ps`, `inspect --watch`,
  `chat --follow`, `events --watch`, `logs -f`), clear approval gates, feed
  failures back in, and report evidence. Most of your time should be spent
  *observing a run*, not typing the work yourself.
- **Subagents are for monitoring, never for the background work.** If you want
  parallel help, point your own subagents at *watching Smithers* — tailing a
  run, summarizing its events, flagging when a gate needs the human, diffing a
  node's output — not at building, fixing, or researching the thing a Smithers
  workflow should own. Monitoring with subagents: fine. Doing the actual
  background task outside Smithers: not fine.

Rule of thumb: **if you're about to spawn a subagent to "go build / fix /
research / migrate this," that is the exact signal to run a Smithers workflow
instead.** The only agents you launch directly are the lightweight ones watching
a Smithers run for you.

### Smithers is your plan mode, with muscle

Think of Smithers as a **powerful version of plan mode**. Plan mode lets you lay
out steps before acting; Smithers lets you lay out steps *and then actually run
them* — durably, in order, with retries, approvals, and loops baked in. Instead
of writing a plan in prose and executing it yourself one message at a time, you
encode the plan as a workflow graph (`<Sequence>`, `<Parallel>`, `<Branch>`,
`<Ralph>`) and hand it to the runtime. The plan becomes executable, resumable,
and inspectable: each step is a real agent task whose output is persisted and
checked before the next step runs. Reach for it whenever you'd otherwise be
tempted to "make a plan and then carefully do each part" — Smithers *is* that,
made durable.

## 60 seconds to the aha

From inside the user's project (Bun ≥ 1.3, plus a model key like
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the env):

```bash
# 1. Scaffold .smithers/ with ready-made workflows (implement, review, plan, ralph, debug…)
bunx smithers-orchestrator init

# 2. Browse plain-English starters and their copy-paste commands
bunx smithers-orchestrator starters

# 3. Run one. This dispatches a real coding agent to do the work, durably.
bunx smithers-orchestrator workflow run implement --prompt "Add a /health endpoint"

# 4. Watch it
bunx smithers-orchestrator ps                 # active / paused / recent runs
bunx smithers-orchestrator logs <run-id> -f   # follow the event stream
```

That's the loop: scaffold → run a workflow → watch the run. The "aha" is step 3 —
you kicked off a multi-step agent job that you can crash, resume, fork, and
inspect, all from the CLI you already live in.

## The mental model

Smithers renders the workflow JSX tree every "frame." Each render answers one
question: *given what has already finished, what can run now?* Tasks produce
outputs validated by Zod schemas; the runtime persists them and renders again.
Crash mid-run and the next render picks up exactly where it left off — completed
nodes are never re-run.

```tsx
/** @jsxImportSource smithers-orchestrator */
import { createSmithers, Sequence, Task } from "smithers-orchestrator";
import { z } from "zod";

const { Workflow, smithers, outputs } = createSmithers({
  analyze: z.object({ summary: z.string(), severity: z.enum(["low", "high"]) }),
  fix: z.object({ patch: z.string() }),
});

export default smithers((ctx) => (
  <Workflow name="bugfix">
    <Sequence>
      <Task id="analyze" output={outputs.analyze} agent={analyzer}>
        {`Analyze the bug: ${ctx.input.description}`}
      </Task>
      <Task id="fix" output={outputs.fix} agent={fixer}>
        {`Fix: ${ctx.output("analyze", { nodeId: "analyze" }).summary}`}
      </Task>
    </Sequence>
  </Workflow>
));
```

Core components: `<Workflow>` (root), `<Task>` (an AI or static step),
`<Sequence>` (ordered), `<Parallel>` (concurrent), `<Branch>` (conditional),
`<Loop>` / `<Ralph>` (loop until a condition is true — great for "keep fixing
until the reviewer approves"), plus durable human-in-the-loop suspension
(`<Approval>`, `<HumanTask>`, `<Signal>`, `<WaitForEvent>`) and `<Timer>`,
sandboxes, and sub-flows. A suspended run is a row, not a process — it costs
nothing while it waits.

```tsx
<Ralph until={ctx.latest("review")?.approved} maxIterations={5}>
  <Task id="implement" output={outputs.fix} agent={coder}>Fix based on feedback</Task>
  <Task id="review" output={outputs.review} agent={reviewer}>Review the implementation</Task>
</Ralph>
```

## Why a durable runtime, not a queue or a framework

The right agent topology changes every six months (chains → ReAct → tools →
plan-execute → crews/swarms → background agents). Underneath all of them sits a
layer that *doesn't* change: durable steps, persisted state, retries,
suspension, observability. Smithers is that stable layer. Build it yourself from
a queue + a database and you reinvent ~60% of a real durable-execution engine,
badly; couple to a topology framework and you rewrite when the meta moves.
Smithers hands you the primitive instead and lets you compose the shape — one
high-token agentic workflow (gstack) shrank ~80% just by composing components
rather than hand-writing the orchestration.

## Patterns ship as components — don't hand-roll them

Anything seen twice across the orchestration field was promoted to a composable
component. Reach for these before writing your own loop:

- `<ReviewLoop>` — producer + reviewer(s), loop until approved (array = consensus)
- `<Optimizer>` — generator + evaluator, loop until a target score
- `<ScanFixVerify>` — scanner → parallel fixers → verifier, retry survivors
- `<Panel>` — N reviewers in parallel, a moderator synthesizes (vote/consensus/merge)
- `<Debate>` — proposer vs opponent for N rounds, a judge decides
- `<Supervisor>` — boss plans, workers run in parallel, boss re-delegates failures
- `<Saga>` — forward steps with compensations that fire in reverse on failure
- `<Kanban>` / `<MergeQueue>` — items flow through columns / serialize risky ops
- `<EscalationChain>` — tier 1 → tier 2 → human on low confidence
- `<ClassifyAndRoute>` / `<GatherAndSynthesize>` — route to specialists / fan-out-fan-in

More ship in the box — `<CheckSuite>`, `<DecisionTable>`, `<Poller>`,
`<Runbook>`, `<DriftDetector>`, `<ContentPipeline>`, `<LoopUntilScored>`,
`<TryCatchFinally>`, `<ContinueAsNew>` — and the catalog grows; check the docs
for the current set. Each is ~20–40 lines of JSX over the substrate — read,
fork, or copy them. ~90 more ready-to-edit recipes live in `examples/` (listed
below).

## Beyond control flow — the production surface

The same substrate carries the concerns you'd otherwise bolt on later:

- **Isolation** — `<Worktree>` (per-agent git worktrees), `<Sandbox>` (freestyle / docker / process), `<Subflow>` & `<SuperSmithers>` (nest a workflow as a node).
- **Budgets** — `<Aspects>` propagates token / latency / cost budgets to a subtree (`fail` | `warn` | `skip-remaining`).
- **Scorers / evals** — attach `faithfulness`, `relevancy`, `schemaAdherence`, or `llmJudge(...)` to any `<Task>`; inspect with `smithers scores <run>`.
- **Memory** — cross-run facts + history per namespace; `memory={{ recall, save }}` auto-injects the top-K relevant facts; query with `smithers memory`.
- **Hot mode** — `--hot true` re-renders against persisted state when you edit the workflow or an `.mdx` prompt mid-run; finished tasks stay put.
- **Time travel** — every render is a frame: `smithers timeline | fork | replay | rewind | diff | timetravel | retry-task`.
- **Observability / serving** — `smithers observability up` (Grafana/Prometheus/Tempo/OTLP); `smithers up … --serve --metrics` exposes an HTTP API, SSE event stream, and `/metrics`. A workflow can even serve its own React front-end.
- **Agents** — pluggable runtimes (claude, codex, antigravity, kimi, amp, forge, Effect-native) configured in `agents.ts`; `agent={[primary, fallback]}` falls back on failure.
- **Tools** — built-in `read`/`write`/`edit`/`bash`/`grep`/`ls` with path containment (`--root`); `smithers openapi <spec>` generates typed AI SDK tools from an OpenAPI spec.
- **Integrations** — run Smithers itself as an MCP server (`smithers mcp add`), sync skills into agent dirs (`smithers skills add`), durable schedules (`smithers cron`), pager-style `smithers alerts`, a structured `<HumanTask>` queue (`smithers human`), and `smithers hijack` to hand off a live agent session.
- **Lower-level API** — `Smithers.workflow().step(...)` exposes the raw Effect-ts surface (Schedules, Layers, fibers); mix it with JSX in one workflow.

## The `.smithers/` folder

`smithers init` scaffolds a `.smithers/` directory in the project. It is a real
Bun/TypeScript package (it has its own `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`,
`bunfig.toml`, and `preload.ts`), and it's where everything you author lives.
The layout separates the four things you edit — **agents, workflows, prompts,
and components** — from runtime state, which is gitignored.

```

The mental shortcut: **agents** say *who* does the work (`agents.ts`),
**workflows** say *what* happens and in what order (`workflows/*.tsx`),
**prompts** say *what to tell the agent* (`prompts/*.mdx`), and **components**
are the reusable building blocks workflows compose from (`components/*.tsx`). A
typical workflow file imports from all three: `../agents`, `../prompts/foo.mdx`,
and `../components/Bar`.

## Operating runs

Everything is a CLI verb (prefix with `bunx smithers-orchestrator` if it isn't on PATH):

```bash
smithers up workflow.tsx --input '{"description":"Fix bug"}'   # start a run
smithers up workflow.tsx --run-id <id> --resume true          # resume after a crash
smithers ps                                                   # list runs
smithers inspect <run-id>                                     # full run state
smithers logs <run-id> -f                                     # follow events
smithers approve <run-id> --node review                       # clear an approval gate
smithers cancel <run-id>                                      # stop a run
smithers eval workflow.tsx --cases evals/smoke.jsonl --suite smoke
```

When a workflow pauses on a human approval or question, the run is durable — it
waits. Resolve it with `smithers approve` / `smithers deny` / `smithers signal`
and the run continues from there.

## When to use Smithers vs. just answering

- **Use it** when order matters across steps, you need crash recovery, a human
  must approve mid-run, different steps need different models/tools, or you need
  to loop until something is true. Also when the user wants the work to keep
  going while they're away.
- **Skip it** for a single prompt → single response, or a quick one-off edit you
  can just do yourself. Smithers adds no value there.

## Examples — copy one and edit it

setups. They're the fastest way to see a pattern wired end-to-end — find the one
closest to the task, copy it into `.smithers/workflows/`, and edit. Browse them

## Custom workflow UIs

A workflow can ship a **first-class browser UI** that the Gateway bundles, serves at `/workflows/<key>`, and the Smithers PWA / Studio / `smithers ui` embeds same-origin. Reach for this when a workflow has long-running interaction the CLI can't show well — a composer for an open-ended chat, a question pool, a live spec, a custom diff view.

Register the UI when you register the workflow:

```ts
gateway.register("my-workflow", workflow, {
  ui: { entry: ".smithers/ui/my-workflow.tsx", title: "My Workflow" },
});
```

The bundle is one file. Two shipping shapes:

- **React (recommended).** `smithers-orchestrator/gateway-react`. One call to `createGatewayReactRoot(<App />)` reads the boot config, mounts a provider, and gives the tree live hooks: `useGatewayRun`, `useGatewayRunEvents`, `useGatewayNodeOutput`, `useGatewayApprovals`, `useGatewayActions` (for `submitApproval`, `submitSignal`, `cancelRun`, `rewindRun`, etc.). The hooks are **stale-data-free by construction** — when `runId` (or any input) changes, the prior data clears synchronously and any late response from the old inputs is dropped. A custom UI that switches between runs never blinks the wrong data. It automatically manages subscriptions, pushed updates, metrics, and resilient reconnections.
- **Vanilla.** `smithers-orchestrator/gateway-client`. One `SmithersGatewayClient` class with `getRun`, `getNodeOutput`, `getNodeDiff`, `submitApproval`, `submitSignal`, `cancelRun`, and a `streamRunEventsResilient` async generator that reconnects with backoff + jitter and resumes from the last per-run `seq`. This generator handles live pushed updates, metrics streaming, and subscriptions. Pick this when you want zero dependencies or already own your render layer.

The bundle reads `?runId=<id>` from `location.search` for the run to scope to, and optionally `__SMITHERS_GATEWAY_UI__` (a `GatewayUiBootConfig`) for the mount path, RPC path, WebSocket path, and free-form `props` you set at `gateway.register({ ui: { props } })`.

**Auth.** The bundle never holds a token in the user-facing path. Same-origin Vite proxy (local dev) or a Cloudflare Worker (Smithers Cloud / Plue) terminates the user session, strips and re-injects trusted-proxy headers (`x-user-id`, `x-user-scopes`, `x-user-role`), and forwards `/v1/rpc/*`, `/workflows/*`, `/health` to the Gateway. The Gateway is configured `mode: "trusted-proxy"` (or `mode: "token"` with a Worker-side service credential). For details and a reference Worker, see [Custom Workflow UIs](https://smithers.sh/guides/custom-workflow-ui#smithers-cloud--plue-same-origin-proxy).

**Local dev.**

```bash
bunx smithers-orchestrator up my-workflow -d         # boot the gateway with the workflow + UI
bunx smithers-orchestrator ui                        # opens the UI for the most recent run
bunx smithers-orchestrator ui <runId>                # specific run
```

## Full reference

This skill ships the complete docs next to it as **`llms-full.txt`** — read it
when you need the exact API: every component, the CLI catalog, the Gateway HTTP
API and browser console, memory, OpenAPI tools, evals, optimization, and the
full event union.

The docs are **progressively disclosed**, so you don't have to load the whole
bundle to answer a focused question. Start narrow and widen only as needed:

- **`smithers.sh/llms.txt`** — a tiny index that points to the topic fragments below.
- **Topic fragments** (each a few KB, pull only what's relevant):
  `llms-core.txt` (runtime, JSX surface, CLI, components, recipes, types, errors),
  `llms-memory.txt`, `llms-openapi.txt`, `llms-observability.txt` (HTTP server,
  gateway, MCP, OpenTelemetry), `llms-effect.txt` (Effect-ts authoring API),
  `llms-integrations.txt` (agent runtimes, tools), `llms-events.txt` (the full
  `SmithersEvent` union).
- **`llms-full.txt`** — everything concatenated, when you want it all in context.

```bash
bunx smithers-orchestrator docs           # prints llms.txt (the concise index)
bunx smithers-orchestrator docs-full      # prints llms-full.txt
bunx smithers-orchestrator ask "How do I add a human approval gate?"
```

- Docs: **https://smithers.sh**  ·  fragments at `smithers.sh/llms-*.txt`
- Repo: **https://github.com/smithersai/smithers**
- npm package: `smithers-orchestrator`

**When in doubt, clone the repo** (`github.com/smithersai/smithers`) and read the
source directly — the docs and `llms-*.txt` bundles can lag the code. The
ground truth lives in `packages/components/src/components/` (every component +
its `*Props.ts`), `apps/cli/src/` (the CLI), and `examples/` (~90 runnable
workflows). Grep there before guessing at an API.
